This was a small project in which I used scrapy to scrape data from the retail website totalwine.com in the Pinot Noir section. 

I obtained the name of the wine, the price, and the description which contains the region. See totalwinelist.py for scrapy code.

See wine-analysis for some simple data manipulation with pandas. I also have the csv file that scrapy created.
